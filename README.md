# Stop-and-Frisk Regression (UCPH – MSc in Statistics)

Personal, cleaned replication of a group assignment for the course *Regression* (University of Copenhagen, MSc in Statistics).  
The goal is to examine whether race is associated with the use of force in NYC stop-and-frisk interactions (2003–2013).  

## Structure
- `scripts/` → R scripts for cleaning, modeling, and diagnostics  
- `figures/` → Plots and visualizations  
- `README.md` → Project description  

## Methods
- Logistic regression (main effects)  
- Splines for non-linear age effects  
- Interactions between race and contextual variables  
- Cross-validation (10-fold)  

## How to run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ginakp99/regression-stopfrisk.git
   cd regression-stopfrisk
